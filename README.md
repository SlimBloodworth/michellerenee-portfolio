## Overview

Welcome to my Portfolio.
It is a work in progress.

## My process

- I decided to use GitHub Pages to host my portfolio site. I love open source, I really like GitHub, and I felt that this platform would be a good way to show my understanding of .git and using a repo such as GitHub. I decided to use the BASH terminal for this project to push, pull, branch, etc.
- I set up the repo and configured the custom domain for GitHub Pages, and verified the custom domain in GitHub Pages for added security.
- I built out a very basic structure for the landing page to test that everything was working the way it should be and to get it up and running. I added some social contact links, a downloadable resume, and started a feature branch to work on.
- I decided to go with a contact email form instead of just a contact CTA button. I feel this will show that I do know how to build forms and use form validations.
- I used freeconvert.com to convert a .png that I wanted to use for a favicon into .ico.
- I started user research for my target audience.
- I started a user journey map.
- I started doing SEO and keyword research for meta description tags and content writing.
- I started gathering and organizing content assets.
- I started lo-fi wireframes.

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- .git
- Git BASH
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Editor

### What I learned

- How to setup the DNS to point to GitHub Pages to host this site. This was a bit of a hassels and I ran into several issues, so it was a lot of informative research in trouble shooting.

### Continued development

- Being a Portfolio, this site will change as my skills and needs dictate.
