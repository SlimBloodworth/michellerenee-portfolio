### Links

- Live Site URL: [michellerenee.dev](https://michellerenee.dev)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

- How to setup the DNS to point to GitHubPages to host this site. This was a bit of a hassels and I ran into several issues, so it was a lot of informative research in trouble shooting.

### Continued development

- Being a Portfolio, this site will change as my skills and needs dictate.

### Useful resources

- [formsubmit.co](https://formsubmit.co/) - I used this to create an endpoint for the email contact for. It offers an option that shields my naked email address and helps prevent spam bots from accessing my email address.
- [A Designer Who Codes instructional video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yg6POD0M30w) - This is a great video on how to set up formsubit for an HTML email form.
